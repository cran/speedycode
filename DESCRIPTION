Title: Automate Code for Adding Labels, Renaming Variables, and
        Converting ASCII Files
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacob Harris
Maintainer: Jacob Harris <jh2689@cornell.edu>
Description: Label, rename, and convert datasets and ASCII files more efficiently. 'speedycode' automates the code necessary for labeling variables with the 'labelled' package, renaming variables with 'dplyr' syntax, and converting ASCII files with the 'readroper' package. Most functions require only the name of the dataset and the code will be automatically written. Some convenience functions useful for converting ASCII files are also included.
